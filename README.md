Hello, there. 😀

We&#39;ve seen people like you before. Mission-minded Adventist professionals trapped in the body of someone who is financially or situationally unable to work as a full-time missionary. It&#39;s hard, we know – you have all these incredible talents like writing, translating, editing, proofreading, graphic design, drawing, or programming, but you&#39;re just not sure how these can be used for God.

We&#39;re here to help you fulfil your dream. ✨

Adventist Commons, an initiative of the Middle East and North Africa Union, is like the &quot;creative commons&quot; of Adventist mission resources for the unreached people groups of the 10/40 window and the world. You would be surprised to know that in many of the world&#39;s major language groups, there isn&#39;t a single Adventist tract or booklet. Or, in places where a few outreach materials have been translated, they are inappropriate for the religious context because they only answer the questions that Western Christians ask.

You see, your talents are needed. No, let&#39;s rephrase that – your talents are _desperately_ needed. This is the mission opportunity you&#39;ve been waiting for! By collaborating with Adventist Commons, you can play an integral part in getting our distinctive Adventist message into the hands of unreached people, right from the comfort of your own home. Do you have skills in writing, translating, editing, proofreading, graphic design, or web development? 🖥📝🎨😀 Learn [here how you can contribute to Adventist Commons!](#contribute)

## Project Overview

[AdventistCommons.org](http://adventistcommons.org/) is an initiative of the Middle East and North Africa Union, an attached Union of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. Adventist Commons provides the global church with Adventist evangelistic and discipleship resources that are:

- Theologically sound, based on the present truth contained in the Three Angels&#39; Messages, with a core emphasis on Jesus Christ.
- Culturally relevant for the people groups of the 10/40 window, prepared and reviewed by Adventist missiologists and theologians
- Unhindered by copyrights that restrict free translation and distribution
- Downloadable and printable from wherever you are in the world
- Made available through an open-source crowd translation platform

[AdventistCommons.org](http://adventistcommons.org/) is an initiative created in response to one of the General Conference Mission Objectives for 2020-2025, which has placed a high church-wide priority on developing resources for mission to those within non-Christian belief systems.

## The Problem

- 5,036,506,980 people live in the 10/40 window. This is 66.3% of the world&#39;s population. 3,044,291,000 (or 60.44%) of those living within the 10/40 window are considered unreached.
- There are 2,851 languages spoken in the 10/40 window. Traditional Adventist publishing only prints in 112 of these languages.
- The worldwide number of languages containing printed Adventist publications has seen a slight decrease, not increase, in the last 8 years.
- Traditional publishing houses in the 10/40 window lack human resources and financial resources to create, translate, and print for many of the minority language groups in their territories.
- Most mission resources in the 10/40 window are &quot;imported&quot; and translated from Western sources, which minimizes the cultural and religious effectiveness. Consider, for example, how a non-Christian would feel reading a tract that talks about how the blood of Jesus will save him. Save him from what? Save him with blood? Considering that Buddhists do not perceive of &quot;sin&quot; in the same way that we do, and considering that Muslims do not believe that Jesus died, you can imagine that an imported resource such as this would have a higher liability for misunderstandings and ineffectiveness. It is also uncommon to find materials dealing with realities that people in the 10/40 window struggle with – demonic harassment, community shame, impurity, avoiding curses and the power of witchcraft, or how to deal with the threat of competing wives. Localized content is a _must_.
- Existing textual manuscripts and artwork are almost always under copyright and licensing restrictions that prevent free accessibility, usage, and translation in any location throughout the globe.

## Objectives

- To create resources which are both contextual and relevant to the people groups of the 10/40 window, and yet clearly preserve the distinctive message and features of the Adventist faith.
- To empower Adventists around the world to translate materials into every written language.
- To provide every Adventist organization, institution, Global Mission Pioneer, front-line worker, and church member with access to evangelistic and discipleship resources such as tracts, booklets, presentation slides, audio files, video files, artwork, and charts. Furthermore, to provide these resources in formats that are simple enough to download, print, and share.

## Features

AdventistCommons.org provides the following features:

- Free print file downloads of culturally relevant evangelism and discipleship resources.
- A multilingual translation platform that allows anyone around the globe to translate and download resources into their own language and dialect.
- Collaboration opportunities for writers, editors, proofreaders, graphic designers, illustrators, and web developers.


## Contribute

Ready to get started? Here&#39;s how you can help:

Developers:

- The translation platform being developed is built on the Codeigniter 3 PHP framework and Bootstrap 4. Though Codeigniter may not be the most advanced framework out there, it allows us to get a minimum viable product out the door sooner due to its simplicity. We're still in the early stages of development and in the process of determining the best way to implement the various features we need. 
- If you're familiar with PHP development, feel free to check out our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/cCdSmpc0/adventist-commons-development) to see what we're up to and see how you can contribute.

## Development

Adventistcommons is developed by developers all around the world. Here are technical stuff about how to participate, if you will.

### Docker Development Setup Guide (experimental)

Docker is a solution to make services work in isolated containers. No need to have local lamp, apache, mysql, php, composer … 

Just install docker and docker-compose and follow steps :
- clone the repository somewhere on your computer
- copy \application\config\database.docker.php to \application\config\database.php
- copy \application\config\config.docker.php to \application\config\database.php
- copy \phinx.docker.yml to \phinx.yml
- Set right on var dirs ``chmod 777 ./var -R``
- Point your terminal project root and launch project with ``sudo docker-compose up``
- run migration with command ```docker-compose exec ac-php-fpm application/vendor/bin/phinx migrate```
- In your browser, go to localhost:8096 (the application) and create your account
- In your browser, go to localhost:8080 (adminer), and connect with parameters Mysql / ac-db / root / somePassword

### Manual Development Setup Guide

Follow the steps below to setup AdventistCommons on your local development environment. We assume you already have a functioning localhost environment with webserver (Apache, Nginx …), PHP and MySQL installed. Instructions are for Windows, Mac OS and Linux.

Let us know if you have any issues with these steps.

#### Code base
- Clone the repository on your localhost environment.
- Setup your webserver vhost. We recommend setting up adventistcommons.local as a server alias and pointing it to the directory where you cloned the repository.
- Install composer : Point your terminal client to the application/ directory, and run `php -r "readfile('https://getcomposer.org/installer');" | php -c php.ini`
- Install dependencies with composer with ```php composer.phar install```
- You may need to install code igniter’s twig extension with command ``php vendor /kenjis/codeigniter-ss-twig/install.php``

#### Database
- Create database in your favorite MySQL client or with command line : ```mysql -u root -pPASSWORD -e "create database DBNAME;"``` (replace PASSWORD and DBNAME with real data)
- copy \phinx.example.yml to \phinx.yml 
- Edit the file [phinx.yml](https://github.com/AdventistCommons/adventistcommons.org/blob/master/phinx.yml#L19-L22) to set your database credentials. The user defined here **must** be able to set structure data : create, alter and drop tables.
- Play migration to have a database up to date : ```php vendor/bin/phinx migrate```

#### Config
- copy \application\config\config.example.php to \application\config\config.php 
- Update "$config['base_url']" (line 26) in the file \application\config\config.php with the alias you used to access the Adventist Commons install (eg. "localhost" or "adventistcommons.local").
- copy \application\config\database.example.php to \application\config\database.php 
- Update 'hostname','username','password','database' (lines 78-81) in the file \application\config\database.php with your database credentials. The user defined here **should not** be able to set structure data : create, alter and drop tables
- On Mac OS, you may need to Edit `config.php` and change 
	- ~~`$config['composer_autoload'] = TRUE;`~~
	- `$config['composer_autoload'] = 'vendor/autoload.php';`
- To be able to test some features you may need to create a folder "uploads" in your document root.

### Software elements

#### Code Igniter

First base of the application. If you do not know it yet, check this : https://codeigniter.com/

#### Migrations

Databases changes are handled in a migrations system : Phinx. To play all migrations, run the command ```php application/vendor/bin/phinx migrate```. The migrations already executed on your system are stored, so you can play many times safely, only not-applied-yet migrations will be applied. When you get others work from code base (git pull or merge), you must play migrations other developers may have added, with same command : ```php application/vendor/bin/phinx migrate```.

The idea of migration is to keep a trace of changes done in database, which can be written as SQL code. Migrations are stored in ```/db/migrations```.

If you want to add a change in database follow these steps :
- create an empty migration ```php application/vendor/bin/phinx create MyFeature``` (replace ~MyFeature~ by a camel case semantic name)
- edit the new migration file, created in `/db/migrations/`, add the ~up~ logic with SQL code on data or structure.
- play you migration with ```php application/vendor/bin/phinx migrate```
- do not forget to add also the ~down~ logic to be able to reverse it. And test it with ```php application/vendor/bin/phinx rollback``` 

And from now, never do structural changes directly in database, use migrations !

#### The container

The **container** is a convenient way to hold and provide access for tool-objects (that we call services) without you have to care about their dependencies. If you create such a class for a feature, or want to use a class from a library, you should register it in the container file ```application/libraries/Container.php```, at that place :

```PHP
private function build()
{
	// Other services
	[…]
	
	// Add a new service here
	
	$this->built = true;
}
```

You can register it using closure, so the class will not be instanciated if not called, like this :
```PHP
$this->set(
	// Here is the name of the service.
	// It could be an abritray string, but the name of the class is a good idea to avoid typo errors.
	\AdventistCommons\Path\To\MyClass::class,
	function () { // Here comes the closure
		// Here we tell how to build the service
		return new \AdventistCommons\Path\To\MyClass();  
	}
);
```

If your class requires some other stuff, you can set it with constructor. Let’s say you need a zip compressor class, you will create its service too and inject it to create you first service :

```PHP
$this->set(
	\AdventistCommons\Another\Path\Zipper::class,
	function () {
		return new \AdventistCommons\Another\Path\Zipper();
	}
);

$this->set(
	\AdventistCommons\Path\To\MyClass::class,
	function () {
		return new \AdventistCommons\Path\To\MyClass(
			// $this refers to the container : this other service must be injected in the constructor
			$this->get(\AdventistCommons\Another\Path\Zipper::class)  
		);
	}
);
```

Service creator can be even more complex, you have the hand on its creation :

```PHP
$this->set(
	\AdventistCommons\Path\To\MyClass::class,
	function () {
		$myService = new \AdventistCommons\Path\To\MyClass();
		$myService->disbaleLog();   // simple method call
		$myService->setZipper(     // inject dependencies via setters
			$this->get(\AdventistCommons\Another\Path\Zipper::class)
		); 
		$myService->setConfig('someStuff'); // or anything else
		
		return $myService; 
	}
);
```

Now, if you want to use the service in your controller, just load the lib and call the service by its name
```PHP

class MyController extends CI_Controller {

	public function __construct()
	{
		…
		$this->load->library( [ …,  "container" ] );
	}
	
	public function MyAction()
	{
		$myService = $this->container->get(\AdventistCommons\Path\To\MyClass::class);
		$myService->proceedTreatment();
		…
	}	

```
