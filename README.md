Hello, there. 😀

We&#39;ve seen people like you before. Mission-minded Adventist professionals trapped in the body of someone who is financially or situationally unable to work as a full-time missionary. It&#39;s hard, we know – you have all these incredible talents like writing, translating, editing, proofreading, graphic design, or programming, but you&#39;re just not sure how these can be used for God.

We&#39;re here to help you fulfil your dream. ✨

Adventist Commons, an initiative of the Middle East and North Africa Union, is like the &quot;creative commons&quot; of Adventist mission resources for the unreached people groups of the 10/40 window and the world. You would be surprised to know that in many of the world&#39;s major language groups, there isn&#39;t a single Adventist tract or booklet. Or, in places where a few outreach materials have been translated, they are inappropriate for the religious context because they only answer the questions that Western Christians ask.

You see, your talents are needed. No, let&#39;s rephrase that – your talents are _desperately_ needed. This is the mission opportunity you&#39;ve been waiting for! By collaborating with Adventist Commons, you can play an integral part in getting our distinctive Adventist message into the hands of unreached people, right from the comfort of your own home. Do you have skills in writing, translating, editing, proofreading, graphic design, or web development? 🖥📝🎨😀 Sign up below to become a valued contributor at Adventist Commons!

## Project Overview

[AdventistCommons.org](http://adventistcommons.org/) is an initiative of the Middle East and North Africa Union, an attached Union of the General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists. Adventist Commons provides the global church with Adventist evangelistic and discipleship resources that are:

- Theologically sound, based on the present truth contained in the Three Angels&#39; Messages, with a core emphasis on Jesus Christ.
- Culturally relevant for the people groups of the 10/40 window, prepared and reviewed by Adventist missiologists and theologians
- Unhindered by copyrights that restrict free translation and distribution
- Downloadable and printable from wherever you are in the world
- Made available through crowd translation and an open-source platform

[AdventistCommons.org](http://adventistcommons.org/) is an initiative created in response to one of the General Conference Mission Objectives for 2020-2025, which has placed a high church-wide priority on developing resources for mission to those within non-Christian belief systems.

## The Problem

- 5,036,506,980 people live in the 10/40 window. This is 66.3% of the world&#39;s population. 3,044,291,000 (or 60.44%) of those living within the 10/40 window are considered unreached.
- There are 2,851 languages spoken in the 10/40 window. Traditional Adventist publishing only prints in 112 of these languages.
- The worldwide number of languages containing printed Adventist publications has seen a slight decrease, not increase, in the last 8 years.
- Traditional publishing houses in the 10/40 window lack human resources and financial resources to create, translate, and print for many of the minority language groups in their territories.
- Most mission resources in the 10/40 window are &quot;imported&quot; and translated from Western sources, which minimizes the cultural and religious effectiveness. Consider, for example, how a non-Christian would feel reading a tract that talks about how the blood of Jesus will save him. Save him from what? Save him with blood? Considering that Buddhists do not perceive of &quot;sin&quot; in the same way that we do, and considering that Muslims do not believe that Jesus died, you can imagine that an imported resource such as this would have a higher liability for misunderstandings and ineffectiveness. It is also uncommon to find materials dealing with realities that people in the 10/40 window struggle with – demonic harassment, community shame, impurity, avoiding curses and the power of witchcraft, or how to deal with the threat of competing wives. Localized content is a _must_.
- Existing textual manuscripts and artwork are almost always under copyright and licensing restrictions that prevent free accessibility, usage, and translation in any location throughout the globe.

## Objectives

- To create resources which are both contextual and relevant to the people groups of the 10/40 window, and yet clearly preserve the distinctive message and features of the Adventist faith.
- To empower Adventists around the world to translate materials into every written language.
- To provide every Adventist organization, institution, Global Mission Pioneer, front-line worker, and church member with access to evangelistic and discipleship resources such as tracts, booklets, presentation slides, audio files, video files, artwork, and charts. Furthermore, to provide these resources in formats that are simple enough to download, print, and share.

## Features

AdventistCommons.org provides the following features:

- Free print file downloads of culturally relevant evangelism and discipleship resources.
- A multilingual translation platform that allows anyone around the globe to translate and download resources into their own language and dialect.
- Collaboration opportunities for writers, editors, proofreaders, graphic designers, and web developers.


## Contribute

Ready to get started? Here&#39;s how you can help:

Developers:

- The translation platform being developed is built on the Codeigniter 3 PHP framework and Bootstrap 4. Though Codeigniter may not be the most advanced framework out there, it allows us to get a minimum viable product out the door sooner due to its simplicity. We're still in the early stages of development and in the process of determining the best way to implement the various features we need. If you're familiar with PHP development, feel free to check out the [Github issues](https://github.com/AdventistCommons/adventistcommons.org/issues) or view our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/cCdSmpc0/adventist-commons-development) to see what we're up to. You can join the Trello board [here](https://trello.com/invite/b/6aSyzetB/eff6e13d9c874e7474d889ffec9afb09/adventist-commons-management). We also have a [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/adventistcommons/shared_invite/enQtNjYzNjAxNTUwMzA1LTEzOTRlMzZkY2ZjYTlmZTRlYThmNzZhMjMxNmQ1NWE5MWNmZDEwYjE3YTA1YWVkMTFmYmQ5YzE5NjIwMGM0MjM) where development ideas and issues can be discussed.

Authors:

- Send us manuscripts that you personally created and own and are willing to release to the Middle East and North Africa Union.
- If you have experience with religious groups that are predominant in the 10/40 window and have an idea of a helpful resource that you believe you could write, send us a summary of your idea and let&#39;s brainstorm together.
- [Add your name to a list](http://adventistcommons.org/) of volunteers who can write Adventist content for a culturally and religiously diverse audience.

Artists:

- Send us Bible art or graphics that you personally created and own and are willing to release to the Middle East and North Africa Union.
- Add your name to a list of volunteers who can create customized Bible art for resources currently under production.

Graphic Designers:

- Volunteer to help us layout the print files of new products as they are translated.

## Development setup guide
Follow the steps below to setup AdventistCommons on your local development environment. We assume you already have a functioning localhost environment with PHP and MySQL installed.

- Clone the repository to the public directory of your localhost environment
- I recommend setting up adventistcommons.local as a server alias and pointing it to the directory where you cloned the repository. If you are using the default "localhost" server address, update [this line](https://github.com/AdventistCommons/adventistcommons.org/blob/master/application/config/config.php#L26) to `http://localhost`.
- Point your terminal client to the application/ directory, and run `php composer.phar update`
- Run the [schema install](https://github.com/AdventistCommons/adventistcommons.org/blob/master/schema.sql) in your favorite MySQL client.
- Update [these lines](https://github.com/AdventistCommons/adventistcommons.org/blob/master/application/config/database.php#L78-L81) with your database credentials.
- Let us know if you have any issues with these steps.
